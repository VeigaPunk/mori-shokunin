# mori-shokunin — corpus

## Coverage map

| Note | Holds | Sources |
|---|---|---|
| `knowledge/observability-census-r1.md` | the six census surfaces, the live receipt, and the finding-id compare contract | `tools/mori-census.sh`, live run 2026-10-15 |
| `knowledge/observability-surfaces-r2.md` | one note per surface family (7, incl. tmux) with Measures/Status/Gaps + six measured census defects | round-2 wave, 2026-10-15 |
| `knowledge/silence-grading-r2.md` | launch-aware, authorship-aware silence-grading decision table with proven/proposed labels | round-2 wave, derived from `lane-silence-r2.md` |
| `knowledge/progressing-weak-r2.md` | authorship discrimination proof (extractable 10-case check, 10/10) + named deferral preconditions | round-2 wave |

## Known gaps

- One note per surface family: **landed round 2** — `knowledge/observability-surfaces-r2.md`
  (seven surfaces incl. tmux; the r1 "six surfaces" framing is superseded) together with
  `knowledge/silence-grading-r2.md` (decision table) and
  `knowledge/progressing-weak-r2.md` (authorship discrimination check).
- `progressing-weak`: the discrimination proof **landed round 2** (runnable check,
  10/10); production admission stays deferred on the r2 census-cutover preconditions
  (`knowledge/silence-grading-r2.md` named checklist).

- **Journal scope (measured 2026-10-15):** the census reads the USER journal only
  (0 segfault lines); the system journal holds 626, with 1228 core dumps. A
  system-journal probe with its own finding id is the named unblock.
